# C.S. John Lee's Data Science Portfolio
  
Below is a list of projects from my GitHub repositories that I'd like to share with you.

## Machine Learning 
- House Price Prediction [[Github]](https://github.com/CSJohnLee/projects_ucb_mids/tree/master/house_price_prediction) [[SlideDeck]](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1B8kliL58PaSFKafOiJD0OPBr-FkByLgqiz3M6acir3o/edit?usp=sharing)    
  Utilized linear regression, decision trees with ensembling methods, and neural networks to predict housing price on a Kaggle dataset.

- [Digit Classification](https://github.com/CSJohnLee/projects_ucb_mids/tree/master/digit_classification)  
  Utilized k-Nearest Neighbors and Naive Bayes models on the MNIST digits dataset to classify digits. Also generated images with Naive Bayes!

## Statistics in R 
- [Comparing Means Lab](https://github.com/CSJohnLee/projects_ucb_mids/tree/master/comparing_means_lab)  
   *Objective:* Address research questions on American National Election Studies (ANES) surveys about voters in United States. Determine what type of test is most appropriately utilized (parametric vs nonparametric, unpaired versus paired)

- [Reducing Crimes Lab](https://github.com/CSJohnLee/projects_ucb_mids/tree/master/reducing_crimes_lab)  
   *Objective:* Examine a dataset of crime statistics to help a political campaign understand the determinants of crime and to generate policy suggestions that are applicable to local government. Create multi-variate linear regression models and determine if the classical linear assumptions are satisifed.

## Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Big Query
- [Lyft Bay Wheels](https://github.com/CSJohnLee/projects_ucb_mids/tree/master/lyft_bay_wheels_data_analysis)  
  An Analysis with Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Big Query, and SQL.

## Programming
- [Migrate](https://github.com/CSJohnLee/projects_ucb_mids/tree/master/Migrate_An_OOP_Project)  
  An Object-Oriented Programming Project in Python. Please refer to [design document](https://github.com/CSJohnLee/projects_ucb_mids/blob/master/Migrate_An_OOP_Project/Design_Doc_CSJL_Final.pdf) for a description and instructions. 

## Research Design Presentations
- [SHIND!G](https://github.com/CSJohnLee/projects_ucb_mids/blob/master/Research_Design_Presentations/SHIND!G.pptx)    
   *Objective*: To develop a research design that could answer an important data science question. Create a slidedeck to pitch to potential stakeholders or investors on this potential project.
- [Celebrity Location Identification for Paparazzi](https://github.com/CSJohnLee/projects_ucb_mids/blob/master/Research_Design_Presentations/Celebrity_Location_Identification_for_Paparazzi.pptx)   
   *Objective*: Apply research design concepts to identify a business problem and reseearch question, and to describe how data science can answer that question.
- [How Your Personal Data Can Help Catch Violent Criminals](https://github.com/CSJohnLee/projects_ucb_mids/blob/master/Research_Design_Presentations/How_Your_Personal_Data_Can_Help_Catch_Violent_Criminals.pptx)  
   *Objective*: To explore a controversial debate in data science that will likely affect a domain of your choice.
